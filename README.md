# React + Axios
Test project where I learned React and Axios.

I created this project as an assignment for an internship. This is simple CRUD project that gets data from API that I can EDIT, DELETE and VIEW using Javascript.

To run this project:

1. Download or fork this repo
2. From the directory of this work type in console **npm -i**
3. Then type **npm start**

After **npm start** a browser should open with project
